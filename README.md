# DataScienceInternship-UCONN Led By Matt Lamoureux (Ex-VP of Data Science @The Hartford)
This repository contains all models and important python files that were created during my Data Science Internship @Uconn

All Files are split into their specified branches:
Learning Branch - Here you will find all of my notebooks containing all of my practice regression models
Developmental Branch - Here you will find EDA as well as feature engineering for our final project dataset
Final Project Branch - Here you will find my group and I's final project regression model
